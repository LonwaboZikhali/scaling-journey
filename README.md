# Map of Africa: HIV Impact Analysis

This repository tells the story of a dark chapter in South Africaâ€™s recent history, when HIV/AIDS swept through the population and left a profound human toll. Through data-driven visualizations, it chronicles how the epidemic unfolded, the lives it affected, and the broader context of public health at the time.

## Context and Insights

In the early 1990s, HIV began to spread rapidly across South Africa, initially unnoticed by much of the public. Limited access to testing, social stigma, and delayed government response allowed the virus to take hold silently.

By the mid-1990s, fatalities from HIV started to rise dramatically. The exponential increase in deaths revealed the scale of the crisis in a period where families, communities, and the healthcare system were overwhelmed. Data from this era shows South Africa as an epicenter in the region, with mortality rates rising faster than in neighboring countries.

The visualizations in this repository illustrate three key perspectives:

1. Rate of Increase of HIV-related Fatalities in South Africa
Charts the alarming surge in deaths, highlighting just how quickly the epidemic escalated.

2. A comparison of HIV Impact in South Africa vs. Other African Countries
Places South Africa in a regional context, showing how the epidemic disproportionately affected the nation relative to its neighbors.

3. HIV Fatalities vs. Other Illnesses
Compares HIV to other causes of death at the time, underscoring the unprecedented scale of the epidemic.

By the early 2000s, there are signs of a flattening or even slight dip in fatalities, which I suspect may coincide with the introduction and gradual rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ARVs). This marks the beginning of a public health response that would eventually save countless lives, even as the virus continued to pose a threat.

Through these data visualizations, we can see not just the raw numbers, but also the human story behind them. A story of suffering, resilience, and the early impact of lifesaving interventions.
